# Dataset

<!--#### ABC: A Big CAD Model Dataset For Geometric Deep Learning-->

We introduce ABC-Dataset, a collection of one million Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models for research of geometric deep learning methods and applications. Each model is a collection of explicitly parametrized curves and surfaces, providing ground truth for differential quantities, patch segmentation, geometric feature detection, and shape reconstruction. Sampling the parametric descriptions of surfaces and curves allows generating data in different formats and resolutions, enabling fair comparisons for a wide range of geometric learning algorithms. As a use case for our dataset, we perform a large-scale benchmark for estimation of surface normals, comparing existing data driven methods and evaluating their performance against both the ground truth and traditional normal estimation methods.

# Download

By downloading the dataset you agree to the following terms:

* The authors give no warranties regarding the dataset.




### Versions

The dataset is versioned to accommodate for future updates of some of the file formats. Currently, the latest version for all file formats is version **v00** (marked by the suffix of the data chunks).

### File Formats

Each model in the dataset consists of the following file formats: _Note: Not all file formats are available for all models due to processing errors, etc. The formats that are always available are meta, step, para, stl2._

| Format         | Description          | Name | Example |
|:---------------|:---------------------|:-----|:-----|
| Meta           | Meta information of the original Onshape documents in form of a yaml document. It lists the author and various other meta information of the CAD model. | meta | [yml](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_metadata_000.yml){:target="_blank"} | 
| Step | Step file format containing the parametric boundary representation (converted from Parasolid), see [format description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21){:target="_blank"}.    | step | [txt](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_step_000.step){:target="_blank"} |
| Parasolid | Parasolid format containing the parametric boundary representation, see [format specification](https://github.com/jswitzer/cad/raw/master/doc/XT_Format_April_2008_tcm1023-62642.pdf){:target="_blank"}.  | para   | [zip](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_parasolid_000.zip){:target="_blank"} |
| Stl parts    |  STL models with parts stored separately in single files zipped together. The triangulation of the stl models is dense but the triangles have arbitrary shapes with possibly extreme interior angles. | stl | [7z](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_trimesh_000.7z){:target="_blank"} |
| Stl complete   | STL models with single parts merged together as one complete model. The triangulation of the stl models is dense but the triangles have arbitrary shapes with possibly extreme interior angles.  | stl2 | [binary](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_trimesh_000.stl){:target="_blank"} |
| Features    | Feature description in form of a list of surface patches and curves according to the description in the supplementary material. Vertex/Face indices correspond to the elements in the object file. Note: Vertices are 0-indexed here, whereas in the object file vertices are 1-indexed per default. | feat | [yml](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_features_000.yml){:target="_blank"} |
| Object    | Obj models with ground truth normals and curvature values at each vertex. The vertex and triangle indices correspond to the indices in the features file. Note: Vertices are 1-indexed here, whereas in the features file vertices are 0-indexed. | obj | [txt](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_trimesh_000.obj){:target="_blank"} |
| Images    | Renderings of the objects from canonical viewpoints that are produced with the processing pipeline.  | img | [png](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_image_000.png){:target="_blank"} |
| Statistics    | Statistical information about the CAD model (in parametric boundary representation) as well as the generated object file (triangle mesh).  | stats | [yml](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_stats_000.yml){:target="_blank"} |
| FeatureScript    | Original FeatureScript definition of the CAD model from Onshape. Represents the generation process of the CAD model.  | ofs | [yml](data/00000050_80d90bfdd2e74e709956122a_featurescript_000.yml){:target="_blank"} |


### Chunks
The dataset is split into compressed chunks of 10000 models according to the file formats. The following files list the urls for all file formats as well as for the single file formats for all chunks:&emsp;
[all_v00](data/all_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[meta_v00](data/meta_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[para_v00](data/para_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[step_v00](data/step_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[stl2_v00](data/stl2_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[obj_v00](data/obj_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[feat_v00](data/feat_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[stat_v00](data/stat_v00.txt){:target="_blank"}


The chunks can then be downloaded for example with <span class="cin">wget</span> or <span class="cin">curl</span>. The following command downloads all meta file format chunks with 8 requests (maximum) in parallel into the folder _meta_ (which has to be created before):

```bash
cat meta_v00.txt | xargs -n 2 -P 8 sh -c 'wget --no-check-certificate $0 -O meta/$1'
```
or alternatively with <span class="cin">curl</span>:
```bash
cat meta_v00.txt | xargs -n 2 -P 8 sh -c 'curl --insecure -o meta/$1 $0'
```


### Checksums/Sizes
We provide md5 checksums and filesizes (in bytes) for all compressed chunks in the following yaml files to check for archive integrity: &emsp;
[md5](data/md5.yml){:target="_blank"}&emsp;
[size](data/size.yml){:target="_blank"}

# Benchmarks

Based on a subset of the CAD models from the ABC dataset, we provide the following benchmarks for the task of surface normal estimation.

### Normal Estimation

The surface normal estimation benchmark consists of meshed CAD models with fixed amounts of vertices (512, 1024 and 2048) and ground truth vertex normals derived from the parametric boundary representation. There is one benchmark for patches (parts) of CAD models and one for full CAD models.

# Processing

For the processing of the step files, we provide [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) containers that contain scripts for meshing, filtering, statistics and rendering.

### Modules
